## How to run HogRider agent

1. Download the '.py' files in this folder and put them into the default ai_challenge/pig_chase folder. [Install the challenge platform follwing instructions on this page.]( https://github.com/Microsoft/malmo-challenge)
2. Use command "python pig_chase_eval_HogRider.py" to run HogRider V.S. ChallengeAgent. Note that itâ€™s necessary to specify PigChaseSymbolicStateBuilder for HogRider in "pig_chase_eval_HogRider.py".
3. Results can be found in "pig_chase_HogRider.json"
4. If the program is aborted due to Minecraft error with TypeNone state transferred in, please retry step 2.

## Approach 

The approach mainly consists of two components: 
(1) agent type recognition based on a generalized Bayesian update, with a hyperbolic tangent function to "squash" the update, and 
(2) a novel Q-learning approach with 
    (a) a warm start based on rule-based human reasoning ([(Watch our vedio on YouTube for more details.)](https://youtu.be/Ho7GZa3Klcc))
    (b) a state-actoin abstraction, and 
    (c) active-epsilon-greedy exploration
    
For details of our algorithm, please refer to the supplementary .pdf file, which is accepted as proceedings in AAAI-18 conference.
